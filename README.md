# 🤖 Social Robotics Assignment 2: Designing a Social Robotics Experiment

This project revolves around designing an experiment using the humanoid robot **Pepper**, focusing on maximizing the **Perceived Intelligence** of the robot through interaction and statistical analysis.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

The objective of this assignment was to develop a social robotics experiment that demonstrates Pepper’s **interactive capabilities** while emphasizing its **perceived intelligence**. The project includes the following components:

- **Developed Application**: Built using **Choregraphe** for Pepper, featuring at least:
  - 🕒 **1 Timeline**: To manage sequential robot behaviors.
  - 💬 **1 Dialog**: For human-robot interaction.
  - 🔄 **1 Switch Case**: To handle decision-making.

- **Video Presentation**: A **1-2 minute video** showcasing the application, edited to highlight Pepper’s perceived intelligence effectively.

- **Goodspeed Questionnaire**: A **Google Form** created to collect responses about Pepper’s perceived intelligence from participants.

- **Statistical Analysis**: A brief report analyzing the results obtained from the questionnaire.

## 📄 Deliverables

### Included Files:
1. **`.crg` File**: The Choregraphe project file for Pepper’s application.
2. **Video File (`.mp4`)**: A 1-2 minute edited video showcasing the interaction.
3. **Google Form Link**: [Goodspeed Questionnaire Form](#) ([Goodspeed Questionnaire Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFO41g2IAYW2GLc-_CgR-gfxhYsMMLRwREPIlKlkOx5nCKtA/viewform))
4. **Report**: A concise document with:
   - Contributions of each team member.
   - Explanation of the application design and its correlation to perceived intelligence.
   - Results and interpretation of the statistical analysis.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Application Features:
- **Timeline**: Coordinates Pepper’s behaviors during the interaction.
- **Dialog**: Facilitates a natural and engaging conversation between Pepper and the user.
- **Switch Case**: Implements decision-making based on user input.

### Design Philosophy:
- The application was designed with the primary goal of maximizing Pepper’s **Perceived Intelligence**. This includes:
  - Smooth transitions between behaviors.
  - Realistic and responsive dialog.
  - Dynamic adaptation to user inputs.

### Statistical Testing:
- The responses from the Goodspeed Questionnaire were analyzed statistically to assess the experiment's success in enhancing perceived intelligence.
